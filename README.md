# unit-4-game

I declared four variable that would hold four random numbers between 1 - 12

i delcared one variable to generate a random number between 19 - 120

i tied an event click function to the page and tied four images to the the four variables holding the random numbers

in each image, i ran a score checker that compared the totals to the computer generated number (between 19 - 120)

the score checker function checked if the total number was either over or matching. if over, it increased losses. if matched, it increased wins. each of these triggered a restart functiuon that reset all random numbers.
